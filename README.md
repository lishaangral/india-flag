# india-flag
This is an attempt at recreating the flag of India using CSS only.
I couldn't find a way to repeat an object radially within a circular path in CSS. 
Thereby, I had to create separate ids for every spoke in the Ashoka Chakra.
I'm pretty sure there is an efficient way to do this and I will find out how.
